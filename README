This is mapping system which plots points collected from a SPOT
personal satellite transmitter.

In simple terms is just checks an email mailbox and parses out
geographical information, which is submitted to a mysql database.

The second part uses the Google Maps API to plot these points, based on
various factors such as time or an assigned 'tag'.

#(this bit doesn't really exist yet!)
#The third part tries to associate images with spot points by correlating
#exif datestamps with the spot time field, and suggesting the best
#image for that point.

The forth is an admin interface which lets you manually assign notes
and images to various points. It then displays them on the map.

 index.php         -  the website code to plot the data
 admin.php	   -  the interface to edit points
 includes/	   -  various important functons and variables
